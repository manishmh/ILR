              The creation of this repository is a vital response to the
              pressing issue of Indigenous language endangerment. With 43
              percent of global languages facing endangerment, the repository
              plays a crucial role in safeguarding the invaluable repository of
              traditional knowledge, memories, values, practices, and unique
              worldviews embedded within these languages. Among the world&apos;s
              7,000 recognized languages, half of which are Indigenous,
              approximately 6,000 languages are currently endangered, with 1,500
              at particular risk (Australian National University: 2021).
              Linguistic forecasts paint a bleak picture, indicating that by the
              end of this century, 50% to 90% of languages could be at risk of
              extinction or severe endangerment.

              In the context of Odisha, where we focus on Indigenous languages,
              the situation is critical. While some languages thrive, others
              like Birhor, Parji, Pengo, Paraja, Gta & Remo are on the brink of
              extinction. According to the UNESCO Atlas of the World&apos;s
              Languages in Danger project, half of the Indigenous languages in
              Odisha are classified as &quot;definitely,&quot;
              &quot;severely,&quot; or &quot;critically&quot; endangered, while
              the remaining are deemed &quot;vulnerable/unsafe.&quot; This
              repository stands as a vital initiative to document, preserve, and
              revitalize these endangered languages, ensuring that the rich
              tapestry of cultural heritage embedded in them endures for
              generations to come.

              By creating an Indigenous language repository, KISS & KIIT aim to
              address the pressing need to safeguard and promote Indigenous
              languages. These repositories serve as invaluable archives of
              linguistic and cultural heritage, providing a platform for
              documentation, research, and revitalization efforts. Additionally,
              they play a crucial role in bridging the gap between traditional
              knowledge systems and modern technology, ensuring that Indigenous
              languages remain relevant and accessible in today&apos;s digital
              world.
