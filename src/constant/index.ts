      desc: "Santali [sat] is by far the largest of the Munda languages and the only one with recognition by the Indian government as an official language. This Kherwarian North Munda language is spoken mainly in the states of Jharkhand and Orissa, with pockets of speakers found in adjacent areas of West Bengal and north and eastward as far as southeastern Nepal and western Bangladesh. As a result of the Santal diaspora of the 19th century, Santali is also commonly found across the entire span of India, as far away as Assam in the northeast or even the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Santali has been written in no fewer than four scripts, Devanagari (Hindi), Oriya, Roman, and the indigenous Ol Ciki or Ol Cemetâ€™ script.",

      desc: "Another of the Kherwarian Munda languages, Ho [hoc] is spoken in two rather distinct varieties in southern Jharkhand and Northern Orissa (Mayurbhanj district). Despite having close to a million and a half speakers, Ho is doubly marginalized in the local mindset, firstly as a low-status tribal language, and secondly dismissed as a debased form of the already devalued Mundari language, to which it is a relatively close sister language.   Ho has been under investigation by Living Tongues since 2005, with K.C. Naik as the primary consultant. The initial recordings for the Ho Talking Dictionary and Online Grammar Project were made in 2007 with Chandra Mohan Haibru serving as the primary consultant. Both of these speakers represent the Mayurbhanj (Orissa) Ho dialect.",
